# Field references

Cross-object field references are a way for an object to get output field(s) of its dependency
(or multiple dependencies) injected into it as a field (or multiple fields). References to only direct
dependencies are supported.

Syntax `"{{dependency1#fieldName}}"` means that value of `fieldName` will be injected as a string instead
of the placeholder. In this case value must be a string, boolean or number.

Syntax `"{{{dependency1#fieldName}}}"` means that value of `fieldName` will be injected without quotes
instead of the placeholder. In this case it can be of any type including objects.

The `fieldName` could be specified in JsonPath format (with `$.` prefix added by default), for example:
`{{dependency1#status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}}`

```yaml
apiVersion: smith.atlassian.com/v1
kind: Bundle

    spec:
      object:

        kind: Sleeper
        metadata:

        spec:
          sleepFor: 3
          wakeupMessage: Hello, Infravators!
        
--- comes later
      status:
        message: "Hello, Infravators!"
  - name: sleeper2
    dependsOn:
    - sleeper1
    spec:
      object:
        apiVersion: crd.atlassian.com/v1
        kind: Sleeper
        metadata:

        spec:

          wakeupMessage: "{{sleeper1#status.message}}"
