# Field references

Cross-object field references are a way for an object to get output field(s) of its dependency
(or multiple dependencies) injected into it as a field (or multiple fields). References to only direct
dependencies are supported.

Syntax `"{{dependency1#fieldName}}"` means that value of `fieldName` will be injected instead
of the placeholder. The existing type is maintained.

The `fieldName` could be specified in JsonPath format (with `$.` prefix added by default), for example:
`{{dependency1#status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}}`

```yaml
apiVersion: smith.atlassian.com/v1
kind: Bundle
metadata:
  name: bundlex
spec:
  resources:
  - name: sleeper1
    spec:
      object:
        apiVersion: crd.atlassian.com/v1
        kind: Sleeper
        metadata:
          name: sleeper1
        spec:
          sleepFor: 3
          wakeupMessage: Hello, Infravators!

--- comes later
      status:
        message: "Hello, Infravators!"
  - name: sleeper2
    dependsOn:
    - sleeper1
    spec:
      object:
        apiVersion: crd.atlassian.com/v1
        kind: Sleeper
        metadata:
          name: sleeper2
        spec:
          sleepFor: 4
          wakeupMessage: "{{sleeper1#status.message}}"
  - name: sleeper3
    dependsOn:
    - sleeper2
    spec:
      object:
        apiVersion: crd.atlassian.com/v1
        kind: Sleeper
        metadata:
          name: sleeper3
        spec: "{{sleeper2#spec}}"
```

## Referring to ServiceBinding outputs

When Service Catalog processes a ServiceBinding, the output is placed in a Secret
(since they might be secret). If they're not secret, it's convenient to directly
reference them in the bundle. This can be done by using `dependency:bindsecret#data.secretkey`.
Secrets inside data fields are stored base64 encoded in kubernetes, but when you refer to
them in Smith they are plain. At the moment, `bindsecret` is the only parameterisation of
the dependency that is allowed.

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: smith.atlassian.com/v1
kind: Bundle
metadata:
  name: ab
spec:
  resources:

  - name: a
    spec:
      object:
        metadata:
          name: ups-instance
        apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: ServiceInstance
        spec:
          clusterServiceClassExternalName: user-provided-service
          clusterServicePlanExternalName: default
          parameters:
            credentials:
              password: mypassword
              host: http://google.com

  - name: a-binding
    dependsOn:
    - a
    spec:
      object:
        metadata:
          name: a-binding
        apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: ServiceBinding
        spec:
          instanceRef:
            name: "{{a#metadata.name}}"
          secretName: a-binding-secret

  - name: b
    dependsOn:
    - a-binding
    spec:
      object:
        metadata:
          name: ups-instance-2
        apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: ServiceInstance
        spec:
          clusterServiceClassExternalName: user-provided-service
          clusterServicePlanExternalName: default
          parameters:
            important: true
            host: "{{a-binding:bindsecret#data.host}}"
            password: "{{a-binding:bindsecret#data.password}}"
```

**Warning: it is not currently safe to have a truly secret field
passed this way (cf `a-binding:bindsecret#data.password`) unless it's inserted
into a secret, as it will be exposed in the parameters of the created object.**
To do the example above correctly, we could instead construct a new secret object
in the appropriate form for a `ServiceInstance` `parametersFrom` secret reference.
In future, this [should be automatic](https://github.com/atlassian/smith/issues/233).

## Early validation

Having references inside an object or plugin means that the final
shape of the object will only be known once the dependencies have
been evaluated. However, because we would like to fail as quickly
as possible if the user has entered invalid parameters, 'example'
values can be specified (as placeholders) so that ServiceInstance
objects and plugins can be evaluated against their json schemas.

Modifying part of the example from the previous section:

```yaml
  - name: b
    dependsOn:
    - a-binding
    spec:
      object:
        metadata:
          name: ups-instance-2
        apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: ServiceInstance
        spec:
          clusterServiceClassExternalName: user-provided-service
          clusterServicePlanExternalName: default
          parameters:
            important: true
            host: '{{a-binding:bindsecret#data.host#"http://example.com"}}'
            password: '{{a-binding:bindsecret#data.password#"fakepassword"}}'
```

The difference here is that the `host` and `password` fields now have an additional
`#`, following which there is a chunk of embedded JSON. This allows us
to validate the parameters against the json schema exposed
by the OSB catalog endpoint (and currently accessible via a field on
Service Catalog's ClusterServicePlan resources). Therefore the above
resource has the provisional `parameters` block for validation purposes
of:

```json
{
  "important": true,
  "host": "http://example.com",
  "password": "fakepassword",
}
```

This means we can check that `important: true` is reasonable and that we are
providing all required fields, though of course host/password themselves may
change. However, if references are used and examples are not provided,
this validation step is ignored.
